Application Setup Guide
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the backend and frontend for the application.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder of the project.

Run the following command to initialize the backend with the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
This will create a package.json file in the backend directory and install the default dependencies.

Install the required backend dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install all the necessary packages listed in package.json.

Once the installation is complete, you can start the backend server (for example, if you're using Express):

bash
Copy code
npm start
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend folder of the project.

Install the frontend dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Once the installation is complete, you can start the frontend server (for example, if you're using React):

bash
Copy code
npm start
Additional Configuration
If you need to configure any environment variables, make sure to add them to .env files in the respective folders.
Ensure the backend is running before starting the frontend if they depend on each other.
